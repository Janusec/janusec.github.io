      <description>Web Administration Administration Portal When listen=false in config.json :
http://your_primary_node_ip_address/janusec-admin/ (first use) https://your_application_domain_name/janusec-admin/ (after certificate configured)
When listen=true in config.json :
http://your_primary_node_ip_address:9080/janusec-admin/ (first use) https://your_primary_node_domain_name:9443/janusec-admin/ (after certificate configured)
When using primary node only, any application domain name can be used for admin.
But if you have one or more replica nodes, you should apply for a seperate domain name for primary node.

      <description>Certificate Management Scenario: You can add and maintain the digital certificate you already have here (for example, the certificate of a corporate website).
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a digital certificate and want JANUSEC to automatically apply for and manage a digital certificate, you can skip this section and do not need to configure it here (usually applicable to personal websites).
Certificate List Open web administration portal and navigate to Certificate Management.</description>

Note：
Scheme From User&amp;rsquo;s Web Browser to Application Gateway is usually HTTPS (digital certificate is required), by ticking the following &amp;ldquo;Redirect HTTP to HTTPS&amp;rdquo;. If you have a certificate already, you can import it at Certificate Management .</description>

      <description>Diagnose Deployment Operating System Operating System should be x86_64 and one of the following:
Debian 9/10/11/12+ (Debian is preferred) CentOS 7/8+ RHEL 7/8+ Time Please make sure the time is correct, time zone may be any.
Service Management systemd is used for Service Management , check :
command -v systemctl
(Expect result: /usr/bin/systemctl)
PostgreSQL Use psql to check PostgreSQL Connection:
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U janusec -W janusec

      <description>Appendix 1: RE2 Regex JANUSEC Application Gateway uses Google RE2 Regular Expression 。
Regex Rule Example 1 Checkpoint: URLPath
Description: checkpoint URLPath represents the path after the domain name in the URL address, for example www.yourdomain.com/blog/show.php?id=1&amp;amp;category=2 ，URLPath is /blog/show.php
RE2 Rule:
(?i)/\.(git|svn)/
Description: (?i) represents case insensitive，/ represents itself, \\. matches the decimal point，(git|svn) matches git or svn, used to block access to the wrongly released source code.
Regex Rule Example 2 Checkpoint: URLQuery</description>

      <description>Appendix 2: PostgreSQL Operations 1 PostgreSQL Installation PostgreSQL is not included in the release package, you should prepare it before installation, required by the Primary Node.
Before the installation of the Primary Node, dbname, dbuser and password should be ready.
1.1 Example with Debian 10 and PostgreSQL 11 apt install postgresql
su - postgres
psql
CREATE USER janusec WITH PASSWORD &amp;lsquo;J@nusec123&amp;rsquo;;

      <description>Appendix 3: High Availability Configuration 1 Architecture Description JANUSEC Application Gateway itself supports the installation of one primary node and multiple replica nodes for load balancing.
If you need to guarantee the high availability of a single node, you can build a high availability node with keepalived.
The recommended architecture for high availability deployment is:
deploy a master node dedicated to backend management, not open to users deploy two or more replica nodes (Replica) and install keepalived on each replica node The following two replica nodes, assuming IP addresses 192.</description>

      <description>Deploy JANUSEC Application Gateway in Docker Container The JANUSEC application gateway is preferred to be deployed directly on the Linux server and listens on port 80/443. It can be used as the K8S Ingress Controller to forward external user requests to K8S Pods (each Pod listens on the same port). If you adopt the direct deployment mode, you can ignore the following content and see Quick Start.
If you want to deploy JANUSEC application gateway inside docker container, please continue to read the following content, for experiential purposes only, not recommended for production environments.</description>

      <description>Data Discovery Data Discovery Introduction In global settings, when the Data Discovery function is enabled, the application gateway will check the field values in the request and response.
When a Data Discovery rule is hit, it will report it to JANUCAT (Compliance, Accountability and Transparency) for data privacy governance.
Data Discovery Report When a Data Discovery rule is hit, it will be reported to JANUCAT through the API.
In order to verify the identity of the sender, an API Key is required.</description>

      <description>Cookie Compliance 1 Introduction to Cookie Compliance Cookies are a typical technology for achieving statistical analysis, personalized recommendations, and personalized marketing/advertising.
They are also subject to personal data protection (such as GDPR) and privacy protection laws (such as ePrivacy Directive/Regulation), and supervisions are becoming increasingly strict.
In areas where relevant laws apply, directly implanting unnecessary cookies into a user&amp;rsquo;s terminal device without obtaining their explicit consent is suspected of infringing on user privacy.</description>

      <description>GSLB (Global Server Load Balance) 1 GSLB Introduction GSLB (Global Server Load Balance) can automatically schedule traffic through custom DNS servers based on the user&amp;rsquo;s IP address.
After GSLB is enabled, the primary node will be mainly used for management and DNS resolution, and will not participate in load balancing of business traffic. The load traffic will all use replica nodes.
Since v1.5.2, Janussec Application Gateway has built-in DNS server and GSLB scheduling function on the primary node.</description>
